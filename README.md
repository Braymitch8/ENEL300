# ENEL300
**Overview**

This project is an RC car controlled by the AVR128DB28. The repository contains the firmware for the AVR128DB28 microcontroller as well as the PCB design files. The RC car is designed for remote operation and integrates embedded systems principles.

**Features**

Wireless control for movement and speed adjustment

Motor driver integration for precise control

Custom-designed PCB for efficient circuit layout

Power management for optimal performance

**Hardware**

AVR128DB28 - Handles motor control and communication

PCB - Designed using KiCad

**Includes**

Motor driver circuit

Power regulation components

Connectivity for external sensors (if applicable)

**Software**

Written in C for embedded applications

Uses standard AVR libraries and low-level hardware control

Implements PWM for motor speed control

**Usage**

Power on the RC car and ensure the microcontroller is running the firmware.

Use the specified control method (e.g., Bluetooth, RF, or wired connection) to operate the car.

Adjust speed and direction based on the implemented control scheme.

**PCB Files**

Gerber files and KiCad project files are in the PCB folder.

Designed for easy manufacturing and assembly.
